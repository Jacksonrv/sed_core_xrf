# XRF plotter

## This code is designed to plot sediment core XRF data in counts. There is the possibility to normalize the element counts to other elements (among other things).

### It was designed to be used on the folder structure in which the data was given to me:


    ├──Folder
      ├──Cruise-number_divenumber_corenumber_etc
        ├──Cruise-number_divenumber_corenumber_runnumber
          ├──batch result.txt
          ├──batch result_settings.txt
          ├──Cruise-number_divenumber_corenumber.tif

### Here is an example output:
